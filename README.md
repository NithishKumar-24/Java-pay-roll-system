💼 Payroll Management System (Java Mini Project)

📌 Project Overview

The Payroll Management System is a Java-based console application that simplifies employee salary management.
It supports Full-Time and Part-Time employees, allowing users to add, remove, search, display, and calculate salaries.
Data is stored in a CSV file for persistence, making the system practical for small-scale payroll handling.

🎯 Objectives

To apply Java OOP concepts in a real-world problem.

To implement file storage (CSV) for data persistence.

To design a scalable mini-project for academic and practical use.



---

🔮 Future Scope

Connect with SQL database for larger employee records.

Add Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.

Develop a web-based payroll system with Spring Boot.

Include salary slips and tax calculations.



---

📌 Limitations

Currently console-based (no GUI).

Suitable only for small-scale payroll (50–100 employees).

Limited validation for incorrect inputs.

📝 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Java OOP and file handling can be applied to build a realistic payroll system.
It is a mini-project suitable for academic submission, resumes, and learning purposes. With future upgrades like SQL or GUI, it can evolve into a major project.
